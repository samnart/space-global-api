# Space Global Project - Project Overview

Space Global is a fully-implemented Spring Boot application designed as a property management platform with robust features for listing, searching, and managing properties. The application follows modern software architecture principles and best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and security.

## Architecture & Technology Stack
### Core Architecture

Spring Boot Framework as the foundation
Layered architecture pattern separating concerns:

- Controllers (HTTP request handling)
- Services (business logic)
- Repositories (data access)
- DTOs (data transfer objects)
- Exception handling layer



### Database Solutions

- PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Flyway for database schema migrations and version control
- Redis for distributed caching to improve performance
- Proper indexing for optimized query performance

### Storage & Media

- AWS S3 integration for file storage (property images)
- Fallback support for MinIO for local development/testing

### Key Features Implemented
#### User Management

- User registration system
- JWT-based authentication for secure API access
- User data validation and secure password handling

#### Property Management

- Complete CRUD operations for property listings
- Property image upload functionality
- Advanced search capabilities with multiple criteria:

- Location-based filtering
- Price range queries
- Property type filters
- Additional customizable search parameters



#### Technical Features

- Spring Data JPA Specifications for dynamic and complex search queries
- Global exception handling for consistent error responses
- Request validation using Spring's validation framework
- CORS configuration for React frontend integration
- RESTful API design following industry standards

#### Security Features

- JWT token-based authentication
- Data validation at request level
- Secure password storage
- CORS policy configuration

#### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for service layer components
- Integration tests for controllers and API endpoints
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths

### Deployment & Running Instructions

#### Prerequisites:

- vscode 
- PostgreSQL database instance
- Redis server
- AWS credentials (or MinIO setup for local testing)


#### Configuration:

- Update application.properties with database credentials
- Configure AWS S3 credentials or MinIO for file storage
- Set JWT secret and other security properties


- Launch Application:
```
  mvn spring-boot:run
```
- The API will be accessible at: http://localhost:8080/api

## Frontend Integration
The application is designed for seamless integration with a React frontend, featuring:

- RESTful API endpoints
- Proper CORS configuration
- DTO pattern for clean data contracts
- Consistent error response format

### Future Scalability
The implementation supports:

- Horizontal scaling with stateless authentication
- Caching mechanism for performance optimization
- Database indexing for efficient large-scale queries
- Microservices-ready architecture pattern

This comprehensive backend solution provides a solid foundation for the Space Global property management platform, ready for production deployment and scale.
